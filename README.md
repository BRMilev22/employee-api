### **From Hating Java to Actually Building Something Cool**

I work mostly as a web developer with TypeScript and JavaScript stuff. At first, I really hated Java. I mean, I already knew OOP from C++, so it wasn't the complexity that bugged me. I just didn't like some of Java's approach, you know, and the syntax felt off. But this year I have a new teacher which actually is a java developer and after hearing some great things about java and springboot I decided to give it a shot.

### üõ† Tech Stack

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3.4.9**
- **Spring Security**
- **JWT**
- **MySQL**
- **JPA/Hibernate**
- **Maven**
- **JUnit 5**

### **What I Actually Built**

This turned out to be my first serious Java project. And honestly, I'm kind of surprised at how it came together. I used **Java 17** and **Spring Boot 3.4.9.** Ended up with a pretty solid Employee Management System. It works well, too.

- **371 RESTful API endpoints** covering all the main CRUD operations (More endpoints to come)
- **100% test coverage** (430/430 integration tests passing) - took forever but worth it
- **JWT authentication and role-based security** - way easier than I expected with Spring
- **Complete leave management system** with approval workflows and document uploads
- **Advanced search and filtering** that actually performs well
- **Clean code structure** following what I learned about Spring Boot patterns
‚û°Ô∏è **[Full list of API endpoints](endpoints.md)** ‚Äì every controller and endpoint is documented there.

### **What I Learned**

Coming from TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++, I figured I knew what Java would be like. But Spring Boot flipped that around for me. The framework takes care of so much boilerplate I was dreading. And the ecosystem, it's more mature than I gave it credit for. Now I actually like Java. The type safety feels familiar, kind of like TypeScript. Tooling is solid too.

**The result?** A working Employee Management System that I'm actually proud of for my first Java project.
